fizzbuzz (0.0.2)

  * Added is_fizz?, is_buzz? and is_fizzbuzz? singleton methods to FizzBuzz class.
  * Added fizz?, buzz? and fizzbuzz? methods to the Integer class via a monkey-patch
    for convenience.
  * Changed behaviour of the FizzBuzz#[] singleton method, so it will yield a FizzBuzz
    result for a given arbitrary Integer value.
  * Re-factored code to make it cleaner, and added more tests and improved coverage.
  * Re-factored FizzBuzz so it now does not assume that we always want to calculate
    results from 1 to n -- it is now possible to calculate FizzBuzz results for given
    n, m values, where n denotes start and m denotes stop value.
